As a child I was consumed with storytelling whether it was reading, creative writing, acting or watching films. Initially I was an avid reader and dreamt of being a writer. I loved books that created visual imagery, such as Douglas Adams Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy; the first book I fell in love with for the dry sense of humour and absurd visuals. I also loved films for the emotions they evoked in me. I still remember the first film that made me cry, it was Monsters Inc. 

GCSE Media Studies gave me my first taste of creating a short film and led me to studying Film Studies at A Level. This has consolidated for me that I love visual storytelling. I see the stories I have been creating as moving images and how to capture these with cinematography.

Filmmaking is an area that Iâ€™d like to study in more depth at University with a view to a career within the creative industries.
