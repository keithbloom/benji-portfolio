As a young child, I liked to create short films. Initially, I used my iPod and iMovie to create stop animation movies using Lego figures to depict fun storylines set to music.  As an older child, I became part of Henry Jenkins participatory culture; a prosumer, wanting to create content for my own YouTube channel.  It was during the first lockdown, when my world shrunk and life went  online, that I started creating short films.  It combined my love of narrative with love of technology and helped me cope with the isolation. I experimented with various video editing software before settling on Premier Pro.  I was self taught, watching YouTube tutorials first on the basics, then on specific skills, such as key framing or colour grading.  

I have recently completed my education, gaining AAB for A Levels in Media, Business and History. I also achieved an A for my EPQ titled “Brexit, was it a remain failure or leave success?”. I have a confirmed place at UEA for BA (Hons) Film & Television Production for deferred entry in 2025. It is my ambition to have a career in the media industry.
