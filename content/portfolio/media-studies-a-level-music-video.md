content="For my A Level media project I had to create a music video and I chose the song Freaks, by Surf Curse. I started the planning by doing a location recce of Brighton, as Brighton has a lot of street art, wall murals and a strong urban identity. This fitted well with the indie rock codes and conventions for a music video. Filming the music video forced me to improve my cinematography skills and I feel that they did improve. I also learnt to use a gimbal which is  a piece of equipment that I had very little experience of using before this project. Finally, the video editing allowed me to think about how to use thought beats whilst editing. I combined the lyrics with the footage and made sure that they linked up together so that as you hear the lyrics, you also see the associated scene.\n\n&nbsp;"
