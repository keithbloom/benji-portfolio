content = "I was asked to perform in this A Level Media Studies music video.\n\nI was tasked to perform the role of an androgynous character who is an outsider in society, a freak if you will. I had to walk backwards in the busy streets of Brighton, the director telling me when it was safe to walk backwards. I couldn't break character by looking at anyone and I needed my walking to look fluid, natural. This required a lot of my physicality skills. I was also filmed in the winter, with low temperatures and I had to look relaxed, not allow myself to tense or shiver in a tshirt and shorts. I had to be filmed in the busy streets of Brighton, often in costume and I had to develop my confidence to not be concerned about the public staring at me with curiosity."
