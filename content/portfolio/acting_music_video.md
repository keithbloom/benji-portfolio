content = "My role was to be an androgynous character who is an outsider in society, a freak if you will. This required a lot of my physicality skills. For example, I had to walk backwards in the busy streets of Brighton, the director telling me when it was safe to walk backwards. I couldnâ€™t break character by looking at anyone and I needed my walking to look fluid, natural. I was also filmed in the winter, with low temperatures and I had to look relaxed, not allow myself to tense or shiver in a tshirt and shorts. I had to be filmed in the busy streets of Brighton, often in costume and I had to develop my confidence to not be concerned about the public staring at me with curiosity.  I was able to make suggestions for the performance, for example, in the shot of me in a top hat, I decided to jump and snatch at the eyes of the rabbit."
