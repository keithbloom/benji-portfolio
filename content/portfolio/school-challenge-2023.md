content="My school set a challenge for all pupils to do something creative. It could have been a piece of writing, artwork, a poem but I wanted to use my media skills and create a short film.\n\nFirst I brainstormed to think of ideas and plot points for my short film.  Next I filmed the footage with my iPhone as I didnâ€™t have any professional equipment or lighting.  Then I found the song that matched the pacing and energy of clips and fitted the theme and feel I was aiming for.  I only had a weekend to produce this which constrained what I was able to achieve but it showed me how efficient I can be with editing and that I can produce something decent in a short period of time. This allowed me to use the built in short cuts of Premier Pro to save time."
