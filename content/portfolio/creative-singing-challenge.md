content="This was one of my earliest ever attempts at video editing.  I used WonderShare Filmora 9 to create this.  It was the first ever video editing software that I learnt.  It was a great one to start with as it didn’t overwhelm me, it was relatively simple, straightforward software to learn.\n\nI created a lip sync to the song God Save the Queen by the Sex Pistols with some infamous clips going around at the time poking fun at the Government at the time as it suited the song which is an anti establishment song.  I saw a clip of someone bungee jumping with a cup of tea and a biscuit which gave me the idea to put a British flag over it and lower the opacity of the British flag so that it became the background."
