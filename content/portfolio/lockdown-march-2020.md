content="I used Da Vinci Resolve 17 to create this video.  I was really passionate about creating this video.  I really enjoyed creating the narrative, I thought about all the stereotypical behaviour during lockdown which I then filmed and edited selecting the right music to tell the story.\n\nIt was my first time back at school following the first lockdown and I was keen to show off my editing skills that I had learnt during the lockdown."
