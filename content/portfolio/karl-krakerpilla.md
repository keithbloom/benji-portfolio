I thought it would be good to represent the issues with taking drugs. First, I came up with the idea of Karl, a cute little caterpillar who likes doing backflips. However, poor old Karl is tempted into taking crack to enhance his backflipping and it all goes horribly wrong for him, he becomes a crackerpillar, not a caterpillar. Once I had the story I began trying to create sprites and backgrounds"
