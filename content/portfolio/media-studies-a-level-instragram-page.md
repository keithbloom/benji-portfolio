content="The instagram account had three core goals. This was to create an identity for the band, to create a fan base and to create a hype around the first album release. The three posters that I created kept consistency with the brand identity, as they took inspiration from the album cover and music video.  I created a trailer to tease the fan base with the imminent release of the music video. I included behind the scenes footage and badges to build a fan base where they would feel part of the band."
