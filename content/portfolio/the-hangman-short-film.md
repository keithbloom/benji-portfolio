content="This is the final film, The Hangman.  I chose to work in a group as I thought this would reflect a more realistic media work environment as most films aren't produced in their entirety by a single person and you need to be able to collaborate, work as a team.\n\nI contributed to the filming and editing of it. We split up the filming of the shots equally but if there was a shot that one of us had a particular vision of, we would be in charge of it.  Luke and I edited it and we created two separate versions of it and then we took the best parts and techniques from the two versions and put them together.  The music was the idea of Luke and me as we wanted a track that suited the teen audience, that would be synonymous with the film."
