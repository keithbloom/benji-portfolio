content="I was tasked with analysing 9 frames from a film of my choice.  I had to analyse the mis-en-scene, the cinematography and the context.  This was a more technical look at how films are created.  I chose the film Inglourious Basterds by Quentin Tarantino.  I felt that this film was beautifully cinematic and would provide me with many talking points from the film.\n\nFirst, I went through the process of evaluating possible clips to analyse.  There were so many to choose from but I tried to find ones that offered a variety of different techniques to discuss.  Once I had narrowed it down to my 9 frames, I went into great depth on each frame, looking at the techniques that had been used to create them.\n\nIt taught me how detailed each frame is, how carefully chosen every angle, every prop, all the colours, the lighting, the framing and composition are.  It gave me a much better understanding of creating scenes and what I could do to convey meaning to an audience when producing short films."
