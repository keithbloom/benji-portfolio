I  made a  short video for my Aunt’s  birthday.  It was  quite long and  so  I’m  only showing  you the bit I  like  the best.   I got  this  idea from  YouTube video’s and  I  hatched a  plan   to  create  it with my  Aunt’s  dream  childhood  crush,  Julio Inglesias!  I  used Da Vinci Resolve and video packs along  with photoshop.
