content="During my first year of studying A Level Media Studies I had to learn how to use film equipment which was new for me, as I had only previously used my iPhone to record and create media.  Previously, I had been used to creating short films with comedy in them, this was my first experience of serious film making.\n\nMy first task was editing two hours of raw footage into a two minute film using Premier Pro.  My next task was to create a minute long film called “The Proposal”. I had to create a script for this which was a new challenge for me.  At first it seemed like a straightforward task but it is much more difficult than it seems to tell a story in only one minute.  Next, I completed all of the pre-production tasks, such as location recce’s, a shot list and a risk assessment.  I learnt a lot from this process, such as when creating a shot list, it is a good idea to create many more shots than you think you need.  Then I did the actual filming.   I learnt the basics of using a camera, such as focussing, shutter speed, different angles and how to perfect the lighting settings.  Then I used Premier Pro to edit the film. Finally, I had to write a critical creative reflection which allowed me to understand where I could have improved my work and understand what had gone well but more importantly this was a good way to look back at my work and understand how I was creating a product."
