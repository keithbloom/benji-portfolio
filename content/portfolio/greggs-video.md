content="I created this video as a bit of fun and to learn a few skills in Premiere Pro.\n\nI created a preset in Premiere Pro, so that I didn't have to keep creating the love heart effects on each image. Then I created a zoom in and zoom out effect which placed more emphasis on the words.\n\nFor the effect applied to the word 'eyes' I used the 'Source Text' tool. The allowed me to setup the effect and then apply it quickly to each letter."
