content="I had to create a promotional video for the YHA. I selected to promote the Brighton YHA and I wanted to get across the narrative of what the Brighton YHA is all about, that it is an urban adventure rather than being in the countryside which a lot of people associate with the YHA.\n\nUnfortunately at the time of this task, I was not allowed out to do any filming due to the very strict first lockdown in the UK.  Instead, I used stock photos to show my idea for the video.\n\nThe YHA loved the idea, I received this email.\n\n_“The video looks great! Thank you so much for sharing._\n\n_If you have or are on any social media, it would be great if you could put this on. If you can then send me a link, we can share and like it using YHA social media accounts._\n\n_Thanks again for sharing, we are really looking forward to seeing what you do next!”_\n\n**Bethan Meredith**\n_Youth Development Officer_\n_YHA England and Wales_"
