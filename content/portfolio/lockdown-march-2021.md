content="I made this short film during the second lockdown with schools closed.  It was such a difficult time for me but I made this video to try and find some enjoyment out of a bad situation.  Compared to the first lockdown video I made, this was a sad one.\n\nAt this stage I did not have any camera skills and I was self taught in using Premier Pro.  At the time in lockdown, online learning was the only available way of learning and I was trying to make the most of my time and watching videos and teaching myself how to use Premier Pro.  This was the best part of lockdown for me."
