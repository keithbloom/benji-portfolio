content = "I was given a brief to create a short breakfast news broadcast for the 18-25 year old audience.\n\nI decided to approach this with a slight comedic tone and I wanted to keep the clips short so that it can be watched in segments as young people get ready for work or study. I filmed it using a green screen and I edited it in Premier Pro. This was a task about editing and it was my first time using Premier Pro."
