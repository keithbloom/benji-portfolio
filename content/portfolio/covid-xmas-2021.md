content="I created this clip to cheer up my family when Covid prevented everyone getting together at Christmas in 2021.  It was my first major attempt at key framing. This allowed me to tell a narrative in a different way which I enjoyed as it didn’t rely on me recording and creating videos at a time when filming was difficult.\n\nHere are snippets from the short film I created for my family.  It contains references to the political situation at the time, of Boris Johnson’s references to Peppa Pig at a CBI conference and the Government’s promise that mixing at Christmas would be allowed to a sudden U turn that it could not be allowed."
