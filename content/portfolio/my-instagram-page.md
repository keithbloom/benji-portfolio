content="I feel like one of the cornerstones of media is understanding how to use Instagram and this is the reason why I chose to set up an account for my Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Award.  I completed my Bronze Duke of Edinburgh and decided to continue to grow my Instagram account.\n\nWhat I have learnt is that consistency of uploading images is key, it isnâ€™t just about uploading a photo."
