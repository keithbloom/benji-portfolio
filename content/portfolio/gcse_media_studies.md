content = "For my GCSE media studies I created a short film for the brief of creating a TV show with a shift in narrative for the fantasy genre.\n\nI had a very clear idea in my head of the story I wished to tell and all the shots I wished to film. I thought about how my story would fulfill the media brief, for example, I chose a teenage girl as the protagonist as this is the most common repeat motif in fantasy films. It also included the idea of a portal which is another very common theme in fantasy films. I used a Lumix GH5 2 camera for the filming and Premier Pro for the editing. I achieved 98% for this GCSE coursework."
