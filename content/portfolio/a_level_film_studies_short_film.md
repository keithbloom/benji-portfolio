content = "I created this film for A Level Film Studies. The brief was to create a 5 minute film from one of 4 different categories provided. I selected the parallel story category.\n\nI started with a storyboard, then I worked on my script which in turn led to my shot list. From this, I made sample shots of my film to see what worked and what did not work. The biggest mistake I made, not having made a film before, was not thinking enough about where I could film or who I could use as actors, thinking about the limitations I had."
