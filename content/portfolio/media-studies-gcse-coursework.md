content="I created two pages for a tabloid newspaper that was based on The Mirror. I had to create a front page and one inner page.  First, I studied the conventions of a tabloid newspaper.  They have a high ratio of images to words, they are informal, use chatty language with sensationalised headlines that make use of alliteration and aim to entertain with news about celebrities or human interest stories.\n\nI thought a lot about the type of news stories I could use for my paper.  In the summer of 2021, I went on holiday to Devon and I noticed how many restaurants and bars were shut or had limited opening hours due to staff shortages.  It gave me the idea for my headline news of “Brexit bites back” as the hospitality industry was struggling with the amount of EU workers who had returned to their home countries at that time.  I spent time trying to capture an image for the front page that appeared nostalgic and mournful.  Marcus Rashford had also become very prominent in the news with the fight against racism, food banks and challenging the Tories for their hypocrisy.  This gave me the idea to focus a story on him and how he was inspiring young people to become more politically active.  My final story was a human interest story and I photographed my aunt looking distraught and wrote a story about a business woman who had lost all her money by investing in cryptocurrency. I followed the styles and conventions of The Mirror newspaper and used Photoshop for the images and InDesign for the pages."
