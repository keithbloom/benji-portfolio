content="My music video was based on the indie rock genre and my album cover needed to reflect this. I researched mainstream bands in my genre.  I identified that bright colours were used to stand out.  I wanted a strong visual image to stand out and a rough feel to reflect the indie genre.  I used InDesign to create it.\n\nI have included some of my original mock ups which I didnâ€™t feel met the indie genre well enough but I liked the simplicity of my idea of using the interrobang."
