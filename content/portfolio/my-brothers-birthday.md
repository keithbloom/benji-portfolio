content="I created a video using Vegas Pro 18 for my brother's birthday.  He loves the 80s and I created my very own 80’s effect based on effects I had seen on 80’s TV shows.  I wanted it to have a very retro feel.\n\nHere are snippets from the video that I created.  The beginning bit was my favourite part of it as it was the first time I could be creative with a video as I was allowed outside to film and it was an 80s TV theme intro."
